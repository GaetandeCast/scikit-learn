- :class:`tree.Tree` now has a method that allows passing test samples
  to compute a test score and feature importance measure.
  The private method `_compute_unbiased_feature_importance_and_oob_predictions`
  is used by forest estimators to provide an unbiased feature importance by
  using oob samples but could be made public to allow the user to pass their
  own test data.
